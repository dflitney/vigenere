# Cipher

A Framework for Exploring Historical Ciphers

### Caesar Cipher

The Caesar cipher replaces each letter in the original text with a
corresponding letter from a rotated alphabet. As such plain text letters
will always translate to the same encrypted letter. This is trivially
attacked via simple frequency analysis; assuming the original text is english
then the most frequent letter in the encrypted text corresponds to "E" in
the original text. Once you know the translation of one letter you have cracked
the code.

### Vigenere Cipher

While the Caesar cipher only uses a single substitute alphabet, the Vigenere
cipher improves upon this by sequentially selecting from a list
of rotated alphabets. This <i>polyalphabetic</i> substitution allows the same
letter to be substituted with a different letter in the
encripted text thus obfuscating the letter frequency relationship.

This is still not a very strong cipher. At its heart
it is simply an extension of the Caesar substitution
cipher, several simple attacks exist, but it is easy to
implement, analyse and fun to play with.

## Implementation details

### Vigenere

A shared key word/phrase is used to select substitution alphabets from
the list of possible rotated alphabets. In this example our key
word is "MYPASSWORD" and the message text is "THIS IS MY SECRET TEXT".

The first letter, 'T', is _substituted_ with the coresponding
letter, 'E', from the alphabet rotated to start with the first key
letter 'M'.

```python
alphabet['A'] = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ "
alphabet['B'] = "BCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ A"
alphabet['C'] = "CDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ AB"
...
alphabet['M'] = "MNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ABCDEFGHIJKL"
                                    ^
```

The next plain text letter, 'H', is _substituted_ from the alphabet
starting with 'Y', i.e. it is replaced with 'E', and so on.

```python
alphabet['A'] = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ "
alphabet['Y'] = "YZ ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRATUVWX"
                        ^
```

We continue encrypting letters against alphabets selected from
the key phrase. Eventually, when we run out of letters in our key
phrase, we cycle back to the beginning.

## Cryptographic attack

There are a number of weakness in the Vigenere cipher:

1. The repeating key means it is possible to search the encrypted text
looking for sequence repeats which give us a clue to the length of the key.

1. Assuming we know, or can guess, the language of the original text then, knowing the
key length allows us to apply frequency analysis once more. The
cipher text can now be treated as N interleaved Caesar ciphers and each can be attacked independently.


## Usage

### Commandline options

```shell
$ python cipher.py --help
usage: cipher.py [-h] [--key KEY] [--encrypt] [--decrypt] [--verbose]
                 [--plain-text-file PLAIN_TEXT_FILE]

Encrypt/decrypt messages using Vigenere cipher method.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --key KEY, -k KEY     The Vigenere cipher key.
  --encrypt, -E         Encrypt message
  --decrypt, -D         Decrypt message
  --verbose, -V         Additional output - handy for debugging!
  --plain-text-file PLAIN_TEXT_FILE, -p PLAIN_TEXT_FILE
                        Path to a file containing the plain text message.
```

### Encrypt a message

```shell
python cipher.py --key=MYPASSWORD -E
Enter your message text: THIS IS MY SECRET TEXT
EEXSR NNCALPTCIWONJHIQ
```

### Decrypt a message

```shell
python cipher.py --key=MYPASSWORD -D
Enter your message text: EEXSR NNCALPTCIWONJHIQ
THIS IS MY SECRET TEXT
```

### API

```python
from cipher.substitution import Vigenere
```

```python
class Vigenere:

    def __init__(self):
        """Â Create a table of all the possible rotated alphabets """

    def encrypt(self, plain_text, key_word):
        """ Encrypt plain text with the given key word """

    def decrypt(self, cipher_text, key_word):
        """ Decrypt the cipher text using the key word """
```
